            I have a ridiculous amount of ideas. that's nothing new, 
            people have great ideas, that lead to completed projects, and so on.
            However...if you know anything about me, you'll also know that I:
            <ol>
              <li>Have close to no free time</li>
              <li>Have close to no energy (I am probably napping)</li>
              <li>Or have already forgotten my great idea.</li>
            </ol>

            so, new ideas all the time are less than ideal. Sure, writing stuff down could work,
            but I'm a computer science student - the only notepads I own are the 
            ones downloaded on my laptop (Shoutout to .md files, .txt files, Notion, and Obsidian). And  
            when I do have paper to use, those hastily scribbled notes always end up crushed and crumpled 
            in the wasteland I call my backpack. Even the plethora of note taking apps
            I've used over the years aren't safe from my super-mega-evil ability to always 
            lose track of things. It took a long time to get my academic notes somewhat organised, 
            let alone every other byte of random notes I have on my laptop.
          </p>

            So why not add yet another digital format to the mix? I suppose the caveat for using my website
            for... what is essentially a to-do list... is that it fulfills a sense of responsibility in me 
            to not disappoint whoever may be reading this. After I put this post up, my next priority for
            the space is, well to be honest a lot of things, but in relation to this: 
            <ul>
              <li>A Page with my actual to-do list</li>
              <li>A way for site visitors to interact with it so I'm actually held accountable</li>
              <li>A third list item I didn't think of- WAIT.</li>
            </ul>
            Genuinely, as I was writing this blog post, I've just thought of something. (see, what'd I tell ya 
            earlier?) Lemme add it real quick: 
            <ul>
              <li><b>A To-do List Leaderboard</b></li>
            </ul>
            I feel like I'm on a roll this evening. Hear me out here- A to-do list where site visitors can leave
            an "interaction" (an emoji or something?) and the tasks with the most interactions give me the most
            motivation to complete! Maybe I'm crazy, but it'll be so fun to implement once I get round to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where was I? Oh right, future projects. I planned to just implement a good old fashioned to do list
            that just so happens to be broadcasted to the vast void of the internet but I feel like this leaderboard
            -like idea might have some potential. This time though, by writing a whole post about it, I don't think I'll 
            forget about this idea. I hope you've enjoyed this little snippet of my chaotic ahh thought process, as I've very 
            thoroughly enjoyed writing my way through it. See you in the next space, dear reader.
