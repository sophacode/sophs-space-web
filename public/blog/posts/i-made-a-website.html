            I really didn't wanna do work (like 2 hours of 
            coursework)... so I spent hours building a 
            website instead? I was inspired by my friends 
            <a href="https://dexo.games">Dexter</a> and 
            <a href="https://josh.software">Josh</a> who both have 
            <i>very</i> cool websites by the way, check them out, 
            bought a domain, and got designing!
          </p>
          <p> 
            This website uses <s>React, Vite</s>  HTML, CSS and Java/Typescript. 
            Before today, I mainly had experience with Python, Java and Haskell 
            (literally only the programming languages I have to learn for University)
            So I suppose there was quite a steep learning curve trying to get
            the initial pages together.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the design, I really liked the idea of Soph's Space, it's my own
            little space on the internet! The icons and logos around the website are
            also space themed, but in the astrological sense of the word, hence, planet!
            I then threw it together in Canva, and here it is!
          </p>
          <img src="/nobgdark.png" alt="My logo" />
          <p>
            I don't expect my website to look like this or have this logo for forever, but
            it's really nice to see it just <i>exist</i> in the online world! ESPECIALLY
            after how long it took to get it up and running on the Cloudflare servers with 
            basically no guide and pure willpower. I hope this will be the first of many,
            many blog posts, but first, I should really do my course work.

            It's been less than 24 hours since the first post and I'm already thinking up so
            many changes for the site....oooops....
          </p>
          <p> 
            I blame my partner. Just this morning he was watching a youtube video on the "indie
            web" and brought up the website <a href="https://onio.club">Onio.club</a> and ooohhhh boy.
            I'd already heard of the indie web before, but going through this website and many others
            throughout the day gave me so many design ideas for my own site. For one, many, if not all
            of the sites are completely static, no fancy frameworks or web apps, just pure HTML - and 
            come to think of it, I have no idea what I was even using React for? I began with it because
            my friend's website used it, but frankly, I don't need it, nor will I probably ever need it for 
            a site as simple as this.
          </p>
          <p> 
            Moving forward - I wanna try and build as much of my website without AI-code as much as possible.
            The initial build was honestly very vibe-coded to get it started, and it certainly looked that way too. 
            The indie web is so creative, and I encourage you- yes, you- to check it out too. I really hope the site 
            doesn't break now.
