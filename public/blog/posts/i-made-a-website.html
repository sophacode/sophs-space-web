          <p>
            I really didn't wanna do work (like 2 hours of 
            coursework)... so I spent hours building a 
            website instead? I was inspired by my friends 
            <a href="https://dexo.games">Dexter</a> and 
            <a href="https://josh.software">Josh</a> who both have 
            <i>very</i> cool websites by the way, check them out, 
            bought a domain, and got designing!
          </p>
          <p> 
            This website uses React, Vite and Typescript. Before today,
            I mainly had experience with Python, Java and Haskell (literally
            only the programming languages I have to learn for University)
            So I suppose there was quite a steep learning curve trying to get
            the initial pages together.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the design, I really liked the idea of Soph's Space, it's my own
            little space on the internet! The icons and logos around the website are
            also space themed, but in the astrological sense of the word, hence, planet!
            I then threw it together in Canva, and here it is!
          </p>
          <img src="/nobgdark.png" alt="My logo" />
          <p>
            I don't expect my website to look like this or have this logo for forever, but
            it's really nice to see it just <i>exist</i> in the online world! ESPECIALLY
            after how long it took to get it up and running on the Cloudflare servers with 
            basically no guide and pure willpower. I hope this will be the first of many,
            many blog posts, but first, I should really do my course work.
